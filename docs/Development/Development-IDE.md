## Contribute Documents

All documents in website is in docs in repository

Doc version -> branch

* In progress -> master
* major_version.x -> rel/major_version （e.g., 0.9.x -> rel/0.9）

Note:

* The pictures in markdown could be put into https://github.com/thulab/iotdb/issues/543 to get url

## Contribute codes

* Leave a comment in the jira issue you want to work.
* Import code style in idea: java-google-style.xml
* Submit PR, use [IOTDB-issue number] as prefix

## Import IoTDB in IDE

### IDEA

* "File" -> "Open" -> choose the root path of IoTDB source code. 
* use `mvn clean compile -Dmaven.test.skip=true`to get target.
* mark directory ***server/target/generated-sources/antlr4*** as source code
* mark directory ***service-rpc/target/generated-sources/thrift*** as source code 

### Eclipse

Using Eclipse to develop IoTDB is also simple but requires some plugins of Eclipse.

- If your Eclipse version is released before 2019, Antlr plugin maybe not work in Eclipse. In this way, you have to run the command in your console first: `mvn eclipse:eclipse -DskipTests`. 
After the command is done, you can import IoTDB as an existing project:
  - Choose menu "import" -> "General" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace" -> Choose IoTDB
   root path;
  - Done.

- If your Eclipse version is fashion enough (e.g., you are using the latest version of Eclipse),
you can just choose menu "import" -> "Maven" -> "Existing Maven Projects".
 

## Debugging IoTDB

The main class of IoTDB server is `org.apache.iotdb.db.service.IoTDB`.
The main class of IoTDB cli is `org.apache.iotdb.client.Client` 
(or `org.apache.iotdb.client.WinClient` on Win OS).

The client needs parameter: "-h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root"

You can run/debug IoTDB by using the two classes as the entrance.

Another way to understand IoTDB is to read and try Unit Tests.

* The implementation of RPC in the server ```server/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb/db/service/TSServiceImpl```
	* JDBC.execute() -> TSServiceImpl.executeStatement(TSExecuteStatementReq req)
	* JDBC.executeQuery() -> TSServiceImpl.executeQueryStatement(TSExecuteStatementReq req)	
	* Session.insert() -> TSServiceImpl.insert(TSInsertReq req)

* Storage Engine: org.apache.iotdb.db.engine.StorageEngine
* Query Engine: org.apache.iotdb.db.qp.Planner
