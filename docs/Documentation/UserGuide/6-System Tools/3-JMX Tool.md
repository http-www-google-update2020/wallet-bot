# JMX Tool

Java VisualVM is a tool that provides a visual interface for viewing detailed information about Java applications while they are running on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and for troubleshooting and profiling these applications. 

## Usage

Step1: Start sever.

Step2: Build connection. For local monitor, connection doesn't need to be built manually. For remote monitor, you can add your own ip address, and config the port. For IoTDB, port is `31999`.

Step3: Start monitoring. By double clicking your connection ip address, you can see the detailed execution information about the application.
