# Chapter4: Deployment and Management

## Deployment

IoTDB provides you two installation methods, you can refer to the following suggestions, choose one of them:

* Installation from binary files. Download the binary files from the official website. This is the recommended method, in which you will get a binary released package which is out-of-the-box.
* Installation from source code. If you need to modify the code yourself, you can use this method.

### Prerequisites

To install and use IoTDB, you need to have:

1. Java >= 1.8 (Please make sure the environment path has been set)
2. Maven >= 3.0 (If you want to compile and install IoTDB from source code)
3. TsFile >= 0.7.0 (TsFile Github page: [https://github.com/thulab/tsfile](https://github.com/thulab/tsfile))
4. IoTDB-JDBC >= 0.7.0 (IoTDB-JDBC Github page: [https://github.com/thulab/iotdb-jdbc](https://github.com/thulab/iotdb-jdbc))

TODO: TsFile and IoTDB-JDBC dependencies will be removed after the project reconstruct.

### Installation from  binary files

IoTDB provides you binary files which contains all the necessary components for the IoTDB system to run. You can get them on our website [http://tsfile.org/download](http://tsfile.org/download). 

```
NOTE:
iotdb-<version>.tar.gz # For Linux or MacOS
iotdb-<version>.zip # For Windows
```

After downloading, you can extract the IoTDB tarball using the following operations:

```
Shell > uzip iotdb-<version>.zip # For Windows
Shell > tar -zxf iotdb-<version>.tar.gz # For Linux or MacOS
```

The IoTDB project will be at the subfolder named iotdb. The folder will include the following contents:

```
iotdb/     <-- root path
|
+- bin/       <-- script files
|
+- conf/      <-- configuration files
|
+- lib/       <-- project dependencies
|
+- LICENSE    <-- LICENSE
```

### Installation from source code

Use git to get IoTDB source code:

```
Shell > git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb.git
```

Or:

```
Shell > git clone git@github.com:apache/incubator-iotdb.git
```

Now suppose your directory is like this:

```
> pwd
/workspace/incubator-iotdb

> ls -l
incubator-iotdb/     <-- root path
|
+- iotdb/
|
+- jdbc/
|
+- iotdb-cli/
|
...
|
+- pom.xml
```

Let $IOTDB_HOME = /workspace/incubator-iotdb/iotdb/iotdb/
Let $IOTDB_CLI_HOME = /workspace/incubator-iotdb/iotdb-cli/cli/

Note:
* if `IOTDB_HOME` is not explicitly assigned, 
then by default `IOTDB_HOME` is the direct parent directory of `bin/start-server.sh` on Unix/OS X 
(or that of `bin\start-server.bat` on Windows).

* if `IOTDB_CLI_HOME` is not explicitly assigned, 
then by default `IOTDB_CLI_HOME` is the direct parent directory of `bin/start-client.sh` on 
Unix/OS X (or that of `bin\start-client.bat` on Windows).

If you are not the first time that building IoTDB, remember deleting the following files:

```
> rm -rf $IOTDB_HOME/data/
> rm -rf $IOTDB_HOME/lib/
```

Then under the root path of incubator-iotdb, you can build IoTDB using Maven:

```
> pwd
/workspace/incubator-iotdb

> mvn clean package -pl iotdb -am -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

If successful, you will see the the following text in the terminal:

```
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Reactor Summary:
[INFO]
[INFO] IoTDB Root ......................................... SUCCESS [  7.020 s]
[INFO] TsFile ............................................. SUCCESS [ 10.486 s]
[INFO] Service-rpc ........................................ SUCCESS [  3.717 s]
[INFO] IoTDB Jdbc ......................................... SUCCESS [  3.076 s]
[INFO] IoTDB .............................................. SUCCESS [  8.258 s]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Otherwise, you may need to check the error statements and fix the problems.

After building, the IoTDB project will be at the subfolder named iotdb. The folder will include the following contents:

```
$IOTDB_HOME/
|
+- bin/       <-- script files
|
+- conf/      <-- configuration files
|
+- lib/       <-- project dependencies
```

<!-- > NOTE: We also provide already built JARs and project at [http://tsfile.org/download](http://tsfile.org/download) instead of build the jar package yourself. -->

### Installation by Docker (Dockerfile)

You can build and run a IoTDB docker image by following the guide of [Deployment by Docker](#build-and-use-iotdb-by-dockerfile)


## Configuration


Before starting to use IoTDB, you need to config the configuration files first. For your convenience, we have already set the default config in the files.

In total, we provide users three kinds of configurations module: 

* environment configuration file (iotdb-env.bat, iotdb-env.sh). The default configuration file for the environment configuration item. Users can configure the relevant system configuration items of JAVA-JVM in the file.
* system configuration file (tsfile-format.properties, iotdb-engine.properties). 
	* tsfile-format.properties: The default configuration file for the IoTDB file layer configuration item. Users can configure the information about the TsFile, such as the data size written to the disk per time(group\_size\_in_byte). 
	* iotdb-engine.properties: The default configuration file for the IoTDB engine layer configuration item. Users can configure the IoTDB engine related parameters in the file, such as JDBC service listening port (rpc\_port), overflow data storage directory (overflow\_data\_dir), etc.
* log configuration file (logback.xml)

The configuration files of the three configuration items are located in the IoTDB installation directory: $IOTDB_HOME/conf folder.

### IoTDB Environment Configuration File

The environment configuration file is mainly used to configure the Java environment related parameters when IoTDB Server is running, such as JVM related configuration. This part of the configuration is passed to the JVM when the IoTDB Server starts. Users can view the contents of the environment configuration file by viewing the iotdb-env.sh (or iotdb-env.bat) file.

## System Monitor

Currently, IoTDB provides users to use Java's JConsole tool to monitor system status or use IoTDB's open API to check data status.

### System Status Monitoring

After starting JConsole tool and connecting to IoTDB server, you will have a basic look at IoTDB system status(CPU Occupation, in-memory information, etc.). See [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html) for more informations.

#### JMX MBean Monitoring
By using JConsole tool and connecting with JMX you can see some system statistics and parameters.
This section describes how to use the JConsole ```Mbean``` tab to monitor the number of files opened by the IoTDB service process, the size of the data file, and so on. Once connected to JMX, you can find the ```MBean``` named ```org.apache.iotdb.service``` through the ```MBeans``` tab, as shown in the following Figure.

<img style="width:100%; max-width:800px; max-height:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20263106/53316064-54aec080-3901-11e9-9a49-76563ac09192.png">

There are several attributes under Monitor, including the numbers of files opened in different folders, the data file size statistics and the values of some system parameters. By double-clicking the value corresponding to an attribute it can also display a line chart of that attribute. In particular, all the opened file count statistics are currently only supported on ```MacOS``` and most ```Linux``` distro except ```CentOS```. For the OS not supported these statistics will return ```-2```. See the following section for specific introduction of the Monitor attributes.

### Data Status Monitoring

This module is the statistical monitoring method provided by IoTDB for users to store data information. We will record the statistical data in the system and store it in the database. The current 0.7.0 version of IoTDB provides statistics for writing data.

The user can choose to enable or disable the data statistics monitoring function (set the `enable_stat_monitor` item in the configuration file, see [Engine Layer](chapter4,enginelayer) for details).

#### Writing Data Monitor

The current statistics of writing data by the system can be divided into two major modules: **Global Writing Data Statistics** and **Storage Group Writing Data Statistics**. **Global Writing Data Statistics** records the point number written by the user and the number of requests. **Storage Group Writing Data Statistics** records data of a certain storage group. 

The system defaults to collect data every 5 seconds, and writes the statistics to the IoTDB and stores them in a system-specified locate. (If you need to change the statistic frequency, you can set The `back_loop_period_sec entry` in the configuration file, see Section [Engine Layer](chapter4,enginelayer) for details). After the system is refreshed or restarted, IoTDB does not recover the statistics, and the statistics data will restart from zero.

In order to avoid the excessive use of statistical information, we add a mechanism to periodically clear invalid data for statistical information. The system will delete invalid data at regular intervals. The user can set the trigger frequency (`stat_monitor_retain_interval_sec`, default is 600s, see section [Engine Layer](chapter4,enginelayer) for details) to set the frequency of deleting data. By setting the valid data duration (`stat_monitor_detect_freq_sec entry`, the default is 600s, see section [Engine Layer](chapter4,enginelayer) for details) to set the time period of valid data, that is, the data within the time of the clear operation trigger time is stat_monitor_detect_freq_sec is valid data. In order to ensure the stability of the system, it is not allowed to delete the statistics frequently. Therefore, if the configuration parameter time is less than the default value (600s), the system will abort the configuration parameter and uses the default parameter.

It's convenient for you to use `select` clause to get the writing data statistics the same as other timeseires.

Here are the writing data statistics:

* TOTAL_POINTS (GLOABAL)

> Note: 
> 
> \<storage\_group\_name\> should be replaced by real storage group name, and the '.' in storage group need to be replaced by '_'. For example, the storage group name is 'root.a.b', when using in the statistics, it will change to 'root\_a\_b'

##### Example

Here we give some example of using writing data statistics.

If you want to know the global successful writing points number, you can use `select` clause to query it's value. The query statement is like this:

```
select TOTAL_POINTS_SUCCESS from root.stats.write.global
```

If you want to know the successfule writing points number of root.ln (storage group), here is the query statement:

```
select TOTAL_POINTS_SUCCESS from root.stats.write.root_ln
```

If you want to know the current timeseries point in the system, you can use `MAX_VALUE` function to query. Here is the query statement:

```
select MAX_VALUE(TOTAL_POINTS_SUCCESS) from root.stats.write.root_ln
```

#### File Size Monitor

Sometimes we are concerned about how the data file size of IoTDB is changing, maybe to help calculate how much disk space is left or the data ingestion speed. The File Size Monitor provides several statistics to show how different types of file-sizes change. 

The file size monitor defaults to collect file size data every 5 seconds using the same shared parameter ```back_loop_period_sec```, 

Unlike Writing Data Monitor, currently File Size Monitor will not delete statistic data at regular intervals. 

You can also use `select` clause to get the file size statistics like other time series.

Here are the file size statistics:

* DATA

|Name| DATA |
|:---:|:---|
|Description| Calculate the sum of all the files's sizes under the data directory (```data/data``` by default) in byte.|
|Type| File size statistics |

|Type| File size statistics |
|Timeseries Name| root.stats.file\_size.SETTLED |
|Reset After Restarting System| No |
|Example| select SETTLED from root.stats.file\_size.SETTLED|

## System log

IoTDB allows users to configure IoTDB system logs (such as log output level) by modifying the log configuration file. The default location of the system log configuration file is in \$IOTDB_HOME/conf folder. 

The default log configuration file is named logback.xml. The user can modify the configuration of the system running log by adding or changing the xml tree node parameters. It should be noted that the configuration of the system log using the log configuration file does not take effect immediately after the modification, instead, it will take effect after restarting the system. The usage of logback.xml is just as usual.

At the same time, in order to facilitate the debugging of the system by the developers and DBAs, we provide several JMX interface to dynamically modify the log configuration, and configure the Log module of the system in real time without restarting the system. For detailed usage, see [Dynamic System Log Configuration](Chap4dynamicsystemlog) section.

### Dynamic System Log Configuration

#### Connect JMX

Here we use JConsole to connect with JMX. 

Start the JConsole, establish a new JMX connection with the IoTDB Server (you can select the local process or input the IP and PORT for remote connection, the default operation port of the IoTDB JMX service is 31999). Fig 4.1 shows the connection GUI of JConsole.

After connected, click `MBean` and find `ch.qos.logback.classic.default.ch.qos.logback.classic.jmx.JMXConfigurator`(As shown in fig 4.2).
<img style="width:100%; max-width:800px; max-height:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13203019/51577204-fe122900-1ef3-11e9-9e89-2eb1d46e24b8.png">

In the JMXConfigurator Window, there are 6 operation provided for you, as shown in fig 4.3. You can use there interface to perform operation.

#### Interface Instruction

* reloadDefaultConfiguration

This method is to reload the default logback configuration file. The user can modify the default configuration file first, and then call this method to reload the modified configuration file into the system to take effect.

* reloadByFileName

This method loads a logback configuration file with the specified path and name, and then makes it take effect. This method accepts a parameter of type String named p1, which is the path to the configuration file that needs to be specified for loading.

* getLoggerEffectiveLevel

This method is to obtain the current log level of the specified Logger. This method accepts a String type parameter named p1, which is the name of the specified Logger. This method returns the log level currently in effect for the specified Logger.

* getLoggerLevel

This method is to obtain the log level of the specified Logger. This method accepts a String type parameter named p1, which is the name of the specified Logger. This method returns the log level of the specified Logger.
It should be noted that the difference between this method and the `getLoggerEffectiveLevel` method is that the method returns the log level that the specified Logger is set in the configuration file. If the user does not set the log level for the Logger. , then return empty. According to Logre's log-level inheritance mechanism, if a Logger is not displayed to set the log level, it will inherit the log level settings from its nearest ancestor. At this point, calling the `getLoggerEffectiveLevel` method will return the log level in which the Logger is in effect; calling the methods described in this section will return null.

## Data Management

In IoTDB, there are many kinds of data needed to be storage. In this section, we will introduce IoTDB's data storage strategy in order to give you an intuitive understanding of IoTDB's data management.

The data that IoTDB stores is divided into three categories, namely data files, system files, and pre-write log files.

### Data Files

Data files store all the data that the user wrote to IoTDB, which contains TsFile and other files. TsFile storage directory can be configured with the `tsfile_dir` configuration item (see [file layer](Chap4filelayer) for details). Other files can be configured through [data_dir](chap4datadir) configuration item (see [Engine Layer](chapter4,enginelayer) for details).

In order to better support users' storage requirements such as disk space expansion, IoTDB supports multiple file directorys storage methods for TsFile storage configuration. Users can set multiple storage paths as data storage locations( see [tsfile_dir](Chap4,tsfiledir) configuration item), and you can specify or customize the directory selection policy (see [mult_dir_strategy](chapter4,enginelayer) configuration item for details).

### System Files

System files include restore files and schema files, which store metadata information of data in IoTDB. It can be configured through the `sys_dir` configuration item (see [System Layer](chapter4,systemlayer) for details).

### Pre-write Log Files

Pre-write log files store WAL files. It can be configured through the `wal_dir` configuration item (see [System Layer](chapter4,systemlayer) for details).

### Example of Setting Data storage Directory

For a clearer understanding of configuring the data storage directory, we will give an excample in this section.

All data directory paths involved in storage directory setting are: data_dir, tsfile_dir, mult_dir_strategy, sys_dir, and wal_dir, which refer to data files, stroage strategy, system files, and pre-write log files. You can choose to configure the items you'd like to change, otherwise, you can use the system default configuration item without any operation.

Here we give an example of a user who configures all five configurations mentioned above. The configuration items are as follow:

```
data_dir = D:\\iotdb\\data\\data  
tsfile_dir = E:\\iotdb\\data\\data1, data\\data2, F:\\data3  mult_dir_strategy = MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy sys_dir = data\\system wal_dir = data

```
After setting the configuration, the system will:

* Save all data files except TsFile in D:\\iotdb\\data\\data
* Save TsFile in E:\\iotdb\\data\\data1, $IOTDB_HOME\\data\\data2 and F:\\data3. And the choosing strategy is `MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy`, that is every time data writes to the disk, the system will automatically select a directory with the largest remaining disk space to write data.
* Save system data in $IOTDB_HOME\\data\\system
* Save WAL data in $IOTDB_HOME\\data

> Note:
> 
> If you change directory names in tsfile_dir, the newer name and the older name should be one-to-one correspondence. Also, the files in the older directory needs to be moved to the newer directory. 
> 
> If you add some directorys in tsfile_dir, IoTDB will add the path automatically. Nothing needs to do by your own. 

For example, modify the tsfile_dir to:

```
tsfile_dir = D:\\data4, E:\\data5, F:\\data6
```

You need to move files in E:\iotdb\data\data1 to D:\data4, move files in %IOTDB_HOME%\data\data2 to E:\data5, move files in F:\data3 to F:\data6. In this way, the system will operation normally.




## Build and use IoTDB by Dockerfile
Now a Dockerfile has been written at ROOT/docker/Dockerfile on the branch enable_docker_image.

1. You can build a docker image by: 
```
$ docker build -t iotdb:base git://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb#master:docker
```
Or:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb
$ cd incubator-iotdb
$ cd docker
$ docker build -t iotdb:base .
```
Once the docker image has been built locally (the tag is iotdb:base in this example), you are almost done!

2. create docker volume for data files and logs:
```
$ docker volume create mydata
$ docker volume create mylogs
```
3. run a docker container:
```shell
$ docker run -p 6667:6667 -v mydata:/iotdb/data -v mylogs:/iotdb/logs -d iotdb:base /iotdb/bin/start-server.sh
```
If success, you can run `docker ps`, and get something like the following:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
2a68b6944cb5        iotdb:base          "/iotdb/bin/start-se…"   4 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:6667->6667/tcp              laughing_meitner
```
You can use the above command to get the container ID: 
```
$ docker container ls
```
suppose the ID is <C_ID>.

And get the docker IP by:
```
$ docker inspect --format='{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' <C_ID>
```
suppose the IP is <C_IP>.

4. If you just want to have a try by using iotdb-cli, you can:
```
$ docker exec -it /bin/bash  <C_ID>
$ (now you have enter the container): /cli/bin/start-client.sh -h localhost -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```

Or,  run a new docker container as the client:
```
$ docker run -it iotdb:base /cli/bin/start-client.sh -h <C_IP> -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```
Or,  if you have a iotdb-cli locally (e.g., you have compiled the source code by `mvn package`), and suppose your work_dir is cli/bin, then you can just run:
```
$ start-client.sh -h localhost -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```
5. If you want to write codes to insert data and query data, please add the following dependence:
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.iotdb</groupId>
            <artifactId>iotdb-jdbc</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
```
Some example about how to use IoTDB with IoTDB-JDBC can be found at: https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb/tree/master/jdbc/src/test/java/org/apache/iotdb/jdbc/demo

(Notice that because we have not published Apache IoTDB version 0.8.0 now, you have to compile the source code by `mvn install -DskipTests` to install the dependence into your local maven repository)

6. Now enjoy it!
